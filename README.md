# VirtualBox (VBox) - Terraform
This project contains a home lab that will implement the following:
     - Contains Terraform files that create resources in VirtualBox.
     - Build and delete VMs using a CSV file.

## Installation and Running the Project
Will provide further information when it becomes available.

## Using the Project
This project makes use of Terraform and VirtualBox in order to deploy VMs. I chose to make this lab using VirtualBox since the resources do not cost money in order to download, install, or use.
